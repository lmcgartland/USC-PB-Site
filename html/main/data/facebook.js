Covering an array of diverse topics, their stories will force you to question existing paradigms and convictions, inspire you to change, and stretch your imagination beyond its ordinary limits.\n\nWhy \u201cTrousdale\u201d?\n\nTrousdale is more than just a main street that stretches from one end of USC\u2019s campus to the other; it is also a place and resource for students to learn, share and grow. Trousdale is traditionally used as a place for student organizations to congregate and promote their causes. Its prime location in the heart of campus makes it a frequent home to the University-wide involvement fair, multiple career fairs and USG election campaigning, amongst others. It is the street that all students, one way or another, find themselves on, but most importantly, it is the street that brings the USC community together.\n\nWhy \"Make Your Mark\"?\n\nUSC students are constantly striving to create impact and make a difference in their communities. This year at TEDxTrousdale 2016, we wanted to showcase USC students who truly embody this quality and give them the opportunity to share their take on what it means to \"make your mark\" on the world.", "start_time": "2016-04-16T10:00:00-0700", "place": {"name": "Joyce J.
